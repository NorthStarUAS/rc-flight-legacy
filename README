The MicroGear project is an advance embedded application for unmanned
aircraft systems.  In includes a functioning open-source kalman filter
for estimating attitude and location based on gps and inertial
sensors.  It also includes an advance PID-based autopilot and a host
of supporting libraries and cool functionality.  It leverages "easy
XML" for config file parsing and several structures and libraries from
the FlightGear project including the "property system" and a number
advanced math routines.

MicroGear is a UAV guidance, navigation, and control device
application that is robust, highly capable, highly configurable, open,
and interfaceable.  Along with high levels of capability, MicroGear
focuses on robustness, high performance, and minimal memory and disk
footprints.


CONFIGURE/COMPILING
===================

1. Add the location of your arm cross compiler binaries to your path.
   This will probably look something like:

   export PATH=${PATH}:/home/curt/Projects/GumStix/gumstix-buildroot/build_arm_nofpu/staging_dir/bin
   export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/arm/3.3.2/bin

   Not that there are some "setpath-*.sh" scripts in the toplevel
   MicroGear tree.  These will need to be modified for your local
   paths, but are there as an an example and for your convenience.

2. Run "./autogen.sh"

3. Run "./configure CFLAGS="-Wall -O2" CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O2" --host=something-something"

   For the "new" Gumstix Open Embedded tools you would use
   --host=arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi

   For the "old" gumstix/verdex tree you would add the cross compilers
   to your path and use --host=arm-linux

4. Run "make"

5. The resulting applications are called "ugear" and "decoder".  You will
   find them in src/main/ and they will need to be copied over to the
   target computer.


MAGNETOMETER HARD IRON CALIBRATION
==================================

Note that many calibration parameters are "hard" coded in the source.
You will need to rerun "make" after any changes to the code.

Hard iron calibration parameters are set in ahrs.cpp, bBx, bBy, sfx, and sfy.

Users need to fill out proper values for their unit if necessary (most
likely will be necessary for you.)  The following link explains some
of the underlying issues with magnetometer sensors as well as how to
more effectively use them.

Calibration procedure overview:

Rotate the sensor at least one full revolution recording the sequence
of hx, hy values (see --log-file on option.)  Plot the recorded hx,hy
pairs and the data will form an ellipsoid, probably offset from the
origin.

The goal of the calibration procedure is to come up with horizontal &
vertical offset and scaling factors that transform this offset
ellipsoid back into a radius=1 circle centered on the origin.

To do this, bBx, bBy are assigned the center poing of the ellipsoid
(offset from the origin.)

sfx, sfy are vertical and horizontal scaling factors that are
multiplied against the recentered ellipsoid to stretch/squash it back
into a r=1 circle.

Any time the sensor is remounted, repositioned, or reoriented, the sensor
will need to be recalibrated.
 
The default values in the code are for a situation where no hard iron
calibration affects observed and no offset or rescaling is needed.

    #define bBy 0.0
    #define bBx 0.0
    #define sfx 1.0
    #define sfy 1.1

As an example, we mount the sensor in the passenger foot well of a VW
Jetta.  We drive two circles, plot hx, hy and observe the resulting
ellipsoid.  In this case the ellipsoid is centered at 0.25, 0.65.  The
total horizontal radius of the ellipsoid is about 0.5 and the vertical
radius is about 0.375.  The both need to be scaled to 1.0 so sfx is
set to 1/0.5 and sfy is set to 1/0.357

    #define bBy 0.65
    #define bBx 0.25
    #define sfx (1.0 / 0.500)
    #define sfy (1.0 / 0.375)
