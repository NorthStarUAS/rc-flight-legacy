WELCOME

The MicroGear project is an off shoot of the MNAV project hosted at:
http://www.sf.net/projects/micronav/

The micronav code is a very simplistic demo application to show some of
the capabilities of the CrossBow MicroNav UAV controller.  (The micronav
may be refered to as MNAV or uNAV.)

The goal of the MicroGear project is to turn the original MNAV demo code
into a full featured, highly capable, highly configurable, advanced UAV
guidance, navigation, and control device, and at the same time build in
a variety of advanced and useful features that don't exist in the demo code.
Robustness, performance, and minimizing memory and disk space footprints are
critical and highest priority features of this code.


CONFIGURE/COMPILING
===================

1. Add the location of your arm cross compiler binaries to your path.
   This will probably look something like:

   export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/arm/3.3.2/bin
   export PATH=${PATH}:/home/curt/Projects/GumStix/gumstix-buildroot/build_arm_nofpu/staging_dir/bin

2. Run "./autogen.sh"

3. Run "CFLAGS="-Wall -O2" CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O2" ./configure --host=arm-linux"

4. Run "make"

5. The resulting applications are called "ugear" and "decoder".  You will
   find them in src/main/ and they will need to be copied over to the
   target computer.


MAGNETOMETER HARD IRON CALIBRATION
==================================

Note that many calibration parameters are "hard" coded in the source.
You will need to rerun "make" after any changes to the code.

Hard iron calibration parameters are set in ahrs.cpp, bBx, bBy, sfx, and sfy.

Users need to fill out proper values for their unit if necessary (most
likely will be necessary for you.)  The following link explains some
of the underlying issues with magnetometer sensors as well as how to
more effectively use them.

Calibration procedure overview:

Rotate the sensor at least one full revolution recording the sequence
of hx, hy values (see --log-file on option.)  Plot the recorded hx,hy
pairs and the data will form an ellipsoid, probably offset from the
origin.

The goal of the calibration procedure is to come up with horizontal &
vertical offset and scaling factors that transform this offset
ellipsoid back into a radius=1 circle centered on the origin.

To do this, bBx, bBy are assigned the center poing of the ellipsoid
(offset from the origin.)

sfx, sfy are vertical and horizontal scaling factors that are
multiplied against the recentered ellipsoid to stretch/squash it back
into a r=1 circle.

Any time the sensor is remounted, repositioned, or reoriented, the sensor
will need to be recalibrated.
 
The default values in the code are for a situation where no hard iron
calibration affects observed and no offset or rescaling is needed.

    #define bBy 0.0
    #define bBx 0.0
    #define sfx 1.0
    #define sfy 1.1

As an example, we mount the sensor in the passenger foot well of a VW
Jetta.  We drive two circles, plot hx, hy and observe the resulting
ellipsoid.  In this case the ellipsoid is centered at 0.25, 0.65.  The
total horizontal radius of the ellipsoid is about 0.5 and the vertical
radius is about 0.375.  The both need to be scaled to 1.0 so sfx is
set to 1/0.5 and sfy is set to 1/0.357

    #define bBy 0.65
    #define bBx 0.25
    #define sfx (1.0 / 0.500)
    #define sfy (1.0 / 0.375)
